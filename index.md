# Government and technology reading list

Reading suggestions for folks in the civic tech and public interest technogy spaces.

This crowdsourced list originated with a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/peterkarman/status/1334506648824582156)
and follow up on some private email and Slack channels. Feel free to [create a PR](https://github.com/karpet/gov-tech-reading-list) and suggest changes.

The "government" links tend to be US-centric but I would be happy to see that change!

No effort has been made to rank or categorize, other than by medium.

The [GitHub Pages version](https://karpet.github.io/gov-tech-reading-list/) of this list may be easier to bookmark.
