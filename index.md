# Government and technology reading list

Reading suggestions for folks in the civic tech and public interest technogy spaces.

This list originated with a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/peterkarman/status/1334506648824582156)
and follow up on some private email and Slack channels. Feel free to [create a PR](https://github.com/karpet/gov-tech-reading-list) and suggest changes.

The "government" links tend to be US-centric but I would be happy to see that change!

No effort has been made to rank or categorize, other than by length and medium.

You can see the GitHub Pages version at https://karpet.github.io/gov-tech-reading-list/.
